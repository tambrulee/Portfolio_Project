## About Project

This portfolio website showcases my skills and highlights both past and ongoing projects. It's designed to attract recruiters, share future work, and invite collaboration on upcoming ideas.

The site features an anime-inspired aesthetic, including a Studio Ghibli-style illustration generated via DALL·E through ChatGPT, based on a real-life photo of me.

Beyond web development, I’ve included design work to set myself apart—blending technical ability with creative flair and offering a glimpse of my personality.

The project was built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and SCSS. While my use of SCSS is still developing, I plan to build on it in future work. Typography is set in Bebas Neue and Avenir, sourced from Google Fonts.

## User Stories

These user stories and acceptance criteria formed the foundation of the design. I aimed to keep the language and layout simple to cater to both technical and non-technical users. Clear call-to-action buttons guide users seamlessly between the homepage, projects, and contact pages.

GitHub links allow technical users to explore my code, while a LinkedIn link offers recruiters a quick way to review my resume and reach out.

The site is compact and efficiently designed, making it easy for visitors to learn about me and navigate to my work without feeling overwhelmed.

## Pages

### 1. Home / About Me

This is the landing page when the user first comes onto the website. It's split into three main sections: a hero image, body of text describing me and a banner showing icons of the coding languages I use.

I decided to use the Scrollspy feature after applying it to the Project page and liking the way it looked. In terms of UX I thought it went well with the overall theme and made the information look nicely compact on the page.

**Wire Frames**

I drew up some rough wireframes. The final outcome came out quite close to the mockups, except less white space. I also eventually decided to remove the badges as I struggled to place them in a way that would be mobile optimised.

## Attribution

### Bootstrap
The portfolio heavily depends on Bootstrap for mobile responsiveness. The Navigation, Footer, Scrollspy, Accordian all came from the Bootstrap library.
