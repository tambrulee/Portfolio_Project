# Portfolio Project

## About Project

This is a project portfolio designed to showcase my skillset alongside past and ongoing projects. I aim to entice prospective recruiters and also use this as a space to plug in any future work I do. I hope to also entice collaborators in the future on any projects I undertake.

The website has an Anime theme. I used a Studio Ghibli style photo which I generated using Dalio in ChatGPT. 

Alongside developing webpages, I'd like to showcase some of the work I do in terms of not just coding but also design. I want to stand out amongst other developers as having flair but also show a bit of my own personality. 

On this project, I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and SCSS. The use of SCSS is quite limited because I'm still learning and I will try it out further in the next project. Bebas Nuaer and Avenir from Google Fonts.

To generate the AI images I asked ChatGPT to convert a real life photo of myself and then add the relevant text for each parts of the website:
