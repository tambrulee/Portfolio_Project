## About Project

This portfolio website was created to showcase my skills, as well as my past and ongoing projects. It serves both as a way to attract prospective recruiters and as a space to share future work. I also hope it will encourage potential collaborators to connect with me on upcoming projects.

The website features an anime-inspired theme, using a Studio Ghibli-style illustration that I generated with DALL-E through ChatGPT.

In addition to web development, I wanted to highlight my design work to differentiate myself from other developers ‚Äî blending technical skills with creative flair and giving a glimpse of my personality.

For this project, I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and SCSS. My use of SCSS is currently limited as I‚Äôm still learning, but I plan to expand on it in future projects. Typography is set using Bebas Neue and Avenir, both sourced from Google Fonts.

The AI-generated images were created by converting a real-life photo of myself.

## User Stories

These are the user stories alongside acceptance critera which served as the basis for the design. I wanted the project to take into consideration non-technical and technical users, therefore I kept the overall language and layout quite simple. I have also created a clear workflow between the homepage, projects and contacts pages through call to action buttons. 

There are also links to Github which allows technical users to find out about my work via my reposititories. External link to Linked In allows hiring managers and recruiters to quickly scan my resume before reaching out to me. 

Overall the website is quite compact and makes good use of space without being overcrowded. It allows the reader to find out about me quickly and move through my site to view my work.

## Pages

### 1. Home / About Me

This is the landing page when the user first comes onto the website. It's split into three main sections: a hero image, body of text describing me and a banner showing icons of the coding languages I use.

I decided to use the Scrollspy feature after applying it to the Project page and liking the way it looked. In terms of UX I thought it went well with the overall theme and made the information look nicely compact on the page.
