## About Project

This is a project portfolio designed to showcase my skillset alongside past and ongoing projects. I aim to entice prospective recruiters and also use this as a space to plug in any future work I do. I hope to also entice collaborators in the future on any projects I undertake.

There is a running theme in the project, instead of using a real photo/headshot of myself I decided to use an Studio Ghibli style photo which I generated using Dalio in ChatGPT. 

Alongside developing webpages, I'd like to showcase some of the work I do in terms of not just coding by also design. I want to stand out amongst other developers as having flair but also show a bit of my own personality. 

To generate the AI images I asked ChatGPT to convert a real life photo of myself and then add the relevant text for each parts of the website:

## Wire Frames

This will contain a link to a PDF which has my Wireframes in it. There will also be a talk through of my justifications for doing everything.

The theme stays the same throughout - burger menu to dropdown on a transparent backgroud when hovered over on pc - otherwise on click for mobile/tablet devices. Actually second thoughts not necessary...

I might create my nav and footer using CSS because I want more creative control over fonts and colours but still may just use Bootstrap for responsiveness. 

Font awesome for icons and may need to use Google Fonts for Bebas Nue and Avenir it will fall back onto standard sans-serif if not available/compatible.
