## About Project

This portfolio showcases my web development skills, featuring both completed and ongoing projects. It's designed to appeal to recruiters, collaborators, and fellow developers by blending creativity with technical ability.

The site features an anime-inspired aesthetic, including a Studio Ghibli-style illustration generated via DALL·E through ChatGPT, based on a real-life photo of me.

Beyond web development, I’ve included design work to set myself apart—blending technical ability with creative flair and offering a glimpse of my personality.

The project was built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and SCSS. While my use of SCSS is still developing, I plan to build on it in future work. Typography is set in Bebas Neue and Avenir, the former was sourced from Google Fonts.

## User Stories

These user stories and acceptance criteria formed the foundation of the design. I aimed to keep the language and layout simple to cater to both technical and non-technical users. Clear call-to-action buttons guide users seamlessly between the homepage, projects, and contact pages.

GitHub links allow technical users to explore my code, while a LinkedIn link offers recruiters a quick way to review my resume and reach out.

The site is compact and efficiently designed, making it easy for visitors to learn about me and navigate to my work without feeling overwhelmed.

## Pages

### 1. Home / About Me

This is the landing page when the user first visits the website. It's split into three main sections: a hero image, a body of text describing me, and a banner showing icons of the coding languages I use.

I decided to use the Scrollspy feature after applying it to the Project page and liking the way it looked. In terms of UX, I thought it went well with the overall theme and made the information look nicely compact on the page.

**Wire Frames**

I drew up some rough wireframes. The final outcome came out quite close to the mockups, except it has a more compact layout with reduced whitespace. I also eventually decided to remove the badges as I struggled to place them in a way that would be mobile-optimized.

**Features:**
- Hero image
- A short bio

### 2. Projects

This second page of the website showcases some of my ongoing projects. It uses a scrollspy with a navigation bar, so viewers can easily find each project and learn more about it.

### Lighthouse Test

I tested the website in lighthouse. Overall I was happy with the results, especially for accessibility. If I had more time I would look at the website performance, otherwise I'm happy that loading times and website speed is gernerally okay.

### Mobile Responsiveness
I used the <a href="https://ui.dev/amiresponsive" target="_blank">Am I Responsive?</a> tool to test the mobile responsiveness of each of my web pages.

## Deployment

### Test 1
First deployment was unsuccessful. The index.html (Home) page was loading but the 'Project' and 'Contact' pages were not. I simply removed the '/' from in front of the file paths and tried again which worked.

### Test 2
As per above, the second attempt was successful and the website is no successfully deployed. Check it out here:

## Known Bugs

### Main navigation bar 
The navigation bar does not stretch all the way across the top of the screen at a 990px (min-width) and upwards resolution. This is an unintended glitch, but overall, it doesn't detract from the usability or the overall look of the website.

## Attribution

### Bootstrap
The portfolio heavily depends on Bootstrap for mobile responsiveness. The navigation, footer, containers, flex grids, scrollspy, and accordion all come from the Bootstrap library.
